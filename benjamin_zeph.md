# BIO OF BENJIMAN ZEPHANAIH

Today i will be writing about Benjiman Zephaniah peot, writer and activist and all the significant things he has done world. He was born on the 15 of april 1958 in Birmingham, England

His mom came from  jamaica and his dad came from bardaedos. In his childhood he ate mostly Caribbean food and sometimes fish and chips, but when he was really good he got jelly. Benjiman was a twin and he also had 6 other siblings. when he was a child he loved play in the street with his friends. Unfortunenately his perants divorsed and he went to live with his mum but life was very hard. school was hard because he had dyslexia so he had trouble reading and writing. in school everybody thought he was just thick because in those days we didn't really know what dyslexia was. even though he was dyslexic he loved words and when he went to church with his mum he performed his poetry infront of the church and became quite popular.

as a teen he got into trouble with the police and as a result, he was sent to stay with his grandma in the caribbean. when he went to his grandma's got intresded in rastafarianism and reaggea music. his behavior improved after that.

when he returned home, he built his reputation and tried to help the world through his peotry and writing. he wrote about things such as racial discrimanation, veganism, habitat loss, refugees and too much money. his poetry isn't classical peotry; it's poetry combined with reaggea.he performed all over the country in loads of different venues

as a result of his work he was offered an OBE but refused because OBE stands for order of the british empire and he thought and still thinks, that empire symbolises black slavery. he was also given a'lot of other awards.

 i think Benjiman Zephanaih's music,books and poetry are great, and he is influenceing the world in a good way.i like reggae
