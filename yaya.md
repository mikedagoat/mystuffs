# Archer Waites Holes 30/4/2020

After reading the first two chapters I think the story is about a kid 
who has been wrongly convicted of a crime he did not do and has been sent to a corrctional facilaty to dig holes in the beating sun with only just enough water to survive.
From just looking at the book cover and the title I would geuss that this book is about a kid in an orange jumpsuit is digging holes in the dessert with a bunch of other kids. Theres also green lizards in the dessert that may be part of the story
I think its the type of opening that  catches the readers attention because at the start of the book your thrown bang into the middle of the story and I think that kind of opening is very effective because it mke you want to read more.
My 5 words to describe Camp Green Lake are dry, sparce, hot, strict and not green.
