Stanley Yelnats came from a poor family living in a tiny apartment.Stanley was very unlucky and thought he was cursed with bad luck because his no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather stole a pig from a one legged gypsy and the gypy cursed Stanley's family forever. Stanleys father was an inventor but every time he did an expirament it failed. He loved his mother and promesed he would wright to her at least once a week. To illustrate his bad luck he was convicted of a crime. He was innocent of the crime he was convicted for and he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. After being convicted of that crime he got sent to a correctional facilaty called Camp Green Lake. it was not like the summer camp67 he imagined when he used to play with his stuffed animals when he was a young boy. he thought that when he was at camp green lake he could make some friends and swim in the lake but in reality he was going to have to wear and orange jumpsuit and dig holes out of a dried up lake. At his school he got teased about his weight and had no friends and was hoping that would change at Camp Green Lake. I'm looking forward to reading more of the book so I can finish doing this and making it a lot better.
