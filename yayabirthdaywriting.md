Normally on your birthday you would eat cake with your FRIENDS. You could buy your cake from a shop or make it yourself. Last year I made my own birthday cake with Niall and I ate about half the icing. I also blew out all of the candles in one go.

  Normally I like to have sleepovers with my friends. Last year I had a sleepover in my backgarden with all of my friends and had an amazing time. Everybody brought a sleeping bag, pyjamas and a toothbrush and we all stayed up super late.

Normally  you would get your presents handed to you in person. My favorite presents I've had over the years, are my skateboard, my amazing nintendo switch and of course my favorite socks.

Normally  you would order pizza or have a barbeque or a buffet or something like that. I would usually have a buffet of bread and more bread and a little bit of nutella. Its great fun to share food with your friends.

Normally you can have your birthday in tons of different places such as a water park, the beach, a soft play or an ice rink. Sometimes i have my birthday party at my house and I always have a fun time with my friends.

This year everything has to be different! It has to change because we're in lockdown so we can't do anything in person.

This year I am going to have my birthday party in Fortnite. Fortnite is a multiplayer game that you can play with your friends and talk to them online. This year I think I will ask for gifts in Fortnite and I might ask relatives to get me Animal Crossing new Horizons for nintendo switch. I might also ask my grandmother (yaya) to get me a Fortnite plushy llama for my birthday.

This year in my Fortnite birthday party I will make a creative map with a fashion show and Simon says and stuff like that in it. I can stay up late playing with my friends. We can't have a sleepover but we can stay up late playing Fortnite.

Even though we are in lockdown i'm sure my birthday party will be a brilliant birthday party and will be super fun.
