Normally on your birthday you would eat cake with you FRIENDS . You could buy your cake from a shop or make it yourself. Last year I made my own birthday cake with Niall and I ate about half the icing I also blew out all of the candels in one go

  Normally I like to have sleepover with my friends. Last year I had a sleep over in my backgarden with all of my friends and had an amazing time. Everybody brought a sleeping bag,pijamas and a toothbrush and we all stayed up super late.

Normally  you would get your presents handed to you in person. My favorite presents ive had over the years are my skateboard my amazing nintendo switch and of course my favorite socks.

Normally  you would order pizza or have a barbeque or a buffet or something like that. I would usually have a buffet of bread and more bread and a little bit of nuttela. Its great fun to share food with your friends.

Normally you can have your birthday in tons of different places such as a water park, the beach, a soft play, an ice rink.

This year everything has to be different! It has to change because were in lockdown so we cant do anything in person.

This year I am going to have my birthday party in fortnite. fortnite is a multi player game that you can play with your friends and talk to them online. This year I think I will ask for gifts in fortnite and I might ask relatives to get me  animal crossing new hirizons for nintendo switch. I might also ask my grandmother yaya to get me a fortnite plushy llama for my birthday.

This year in my fortnite birthday party I will make a creative map with a fashion show and simon says and stuff like that in it so I can stay up late playing with my friends. We cant have a sleepover but we can stay up late playing fortnite.

Even though we are in lockdown im sure my birthday party will be a brilliant birthday party and will be super fun.
