# Memories of School

 In August I will be going to high school so heres a few paragraphs about my best expieriences in Bun Sgoil Taobh na Pairce.
 
#### When I went on the school trip to Glen Mor, it was the highlight of P7 for me. I had an outstanding time even though the food was horrible
. When we did orientiering I had such a fun time with Alex because we took a ''Short cut'' through a bog and we both got soaked. To get to Glen Mor we 
had to take a 3 AND A HALF HOUR BUS RIDE!. I got to sleep in a room with Hector and stay up until 10pm making braclets when me an Hectors friend ,Lachie's roommate James was snoring in the middle of the night he got to have a sleep over with me and Hector because he could not sleep in his room.
Then we took a coach all the way back to school.

Another thing that happend in the 7 years I was in primary school is all of th playground crazes such as; Loom bands, Pokemon cards, Yu-Gi-Oh cards,
Football cards, zelda, Fortnite, Brawl Stars and Beyblade burst. When all of these playground crazes were happening I had such a fun time doing them with my friends
The only playground craze that is alive right now is Fortnite and since the lockdown is happening right now Fortnite is a great way to stay 
in touch with my friends.

Celabraition days are a major part of my school and my favorite clebraition day is sports day becuase we get to spend all day outside and when its done EVERYONE 
gets a FREE ice-cream. Another celabraition day I really like is halloween, because my school has a huge Halloween party
 with tons of fun games like apple bobbing and another one where you have to eat the donut that is attached to a string. When celabraition days are finished I get to go home and spend time with mummy.
 
 In P6 and some other people went to Cuppa na Cloine wich is this Gaelic football tournament I really liked an so did all of my friends. in are football team there was 
 3 different teams there was TNP A, TNP B and TNP C I was in TNP C and TNP B came first in the whole tournament it was such a wonderfull expierence and it is also where i scored my first ever goal for the school football team.
 I brought tons of healthy snack such as dried mango and raisins. It was the best football expierience ive ever had in my whole life and I will never forget it.
 
 One of the funniest expierences ive had in school is when me and my friend John tried to audition for the school talent show. We  did'nt make it
 through but it was still really fun. Me and John did'nt relly reherse so I think that is one of the  reasons we did'nt make it through.
 when we did finish are act the judges called us cring :(. 
 
 Thank you very much for reading this and until next time goodbye.
