Stanleyâ€™s family is cursed because of something that happened to his great great grandfather, Elya Yelnats. Elya Yelnats was born in Latvia. At the age of fifteen, he fell in love with Myra Menke. To win over her father he went to an Egyptian woman called Madame Zeroni and Madame Zeroni gave him one of her piglets. Madame Zeroni told Elya to carry the pig up the a mountain every day and sing to it when it drank from a special stream far up the mountain  butt in return she wanted him to carry her up the stream once so she drink from it before she died however he decided not to marry Myra and went on a boat to sail to america and he totally forgot about his promise to Madame Zeroni. Because he forgot, all his decendants got cursed with bad for all eternity.

We know this because the auther says this in chapter 7.

This shows that Stanley believes he is always in the wrong place at the wrong time and he believes in the curse.
